      Tom Cooper, a frustrated travel writer with a bad drinking habit, is on a flight to Moscow to meet an old friend from university. He had failed in love – his wife divorced him – and he had failed as a writer – he was never able to replicate the success of his first and only book – so he had decided to give up everything and hit the road in search of inspiration, and crossing Russia by motorbike sounded like a good plan at the moment.
