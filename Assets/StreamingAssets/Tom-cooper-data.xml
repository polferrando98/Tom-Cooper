      Tom Cooper, a frustrated travel writer with a bad drinking habit, is waiting for a flight to
Moscow to meet an old friend from university. He has failed in love – his wife divorced him –
and he has failed as a writer – he was never able to replicate the success of his first and only
book – so he has decided to give up everything and hit the road in search of inspiration, and
crossing Russia by motorbike sounded like a good plan at the moment.

      Yes, the Russians! They invade Ukraine, they invade my country because they don’t want
Ukraine friends with Europe, now they say they didn’t, they say it’s Ukraninan rebels. Now
Ukranian rebels shot down plane. How can rebels shoot down a plane!? With Kalashnikov? Ha!
This big weapons, this Russian missile. Don’t say they not Russian…

    Yes, I travelled there by bike when the USSR disintegrated, visited all the former
republics in the west and wrote a book about it. I met lots of people.

I don’t know. He could have moved to the capital when the conflict started, but he didn’t
want to leave his flat, he was afraid of looters. I haven’t heard from him in a while.
